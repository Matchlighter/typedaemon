Currently licensed under the terms of the AGPLv3. This is mostly due to the `@resumable` stuff, which I consider to be pretty neat tech, so I want to keep it under my control. If you're using this project personally, you probably don't need to worry much about this. If you're using it (or parts of it) commercially, the AGPLv3 is to apply in full and requires any derivative works to be released under the same license.
